 * Author: Scott Parker
 * Created on January 31, 2017, 1:02 PM
 * Purpose: Gaddis, 8thEd, Chap6, Prob1
 * 1. Markup
 * Write a program that asks the user to enter an item’s wholesale cost and 
 * its markup percentage. It should then display the item’s retail price. For 
 * example:
 * • If an item’s wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 100%, then
 * the item’s retail price is 10.00.
 * • If an item’s wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50%, then
 * the item’s retail price is 7.50.
 * The program should have a function named calculateRetail that receives the 
 * wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments and returns the retail
 * price of the item.
 * Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for either the wholesale 
 * cost of the item or the markup percentage.
