 * Purpose: Gaddis, 8th Edition, Chapter 5, Problem 13, The Greatest 
 * and Least of These
 * Write a program with a loop that lets the user enter a series of integers. 
 * The user should enter âˆ’99 to signal the end of the series. After all the 
 * numbers have been entered, the program should display the largest and 
 * smallest numbers entered.
