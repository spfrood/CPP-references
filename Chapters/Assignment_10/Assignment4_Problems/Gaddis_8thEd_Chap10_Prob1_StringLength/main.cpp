 * Purpose: Prob 1) String Length
Write a function that returns an integer and accepts a pointer to a C-string as 
an argument. The function should count the number of characters in the string 
and return that number. Demonstrate the function in a simple program that asks 
the user to input a string, passes it to the function, and then displays the 
functionâ€™s return value.
