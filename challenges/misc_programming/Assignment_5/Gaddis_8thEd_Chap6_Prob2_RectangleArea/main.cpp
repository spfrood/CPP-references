 * Purpose: Gaddis, 8thEd, Chap6, Prob2
 * 2. Rectangle Area—Complete the Program
 * If you have downloaded this book’s source code from the companion Web site, 
 * you will find a partially written program named AreaRectangle.cpp in the 
 * Chapter 06 folder. (The companion Web site is at 
 * www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis .) Your job is to complete the program. When 
 * it is complete, the program will ask the user to enter the width and length 
 * of a rectangle and then display the rectangle’s area. The program calls the 
 * following functions, which have not been written:
 * • getLength – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s 
 * length and then return that value as a double . 
 * • getWidth – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s width
 * and then return that value as a double .
 * • getArea – This function should accept the rectangle’s length and width as 
 * arguments and return the rectangle’s area. The area is calculated by 
 * multiplying the length by the width. 
 * • displayData – This function should accept the rectangle’s length, width, 
 * and area as arguments and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.
